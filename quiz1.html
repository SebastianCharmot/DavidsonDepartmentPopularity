        What department is the most popular at Davidson College?
    </h1>

    <p>
        Knowing what department is the most popular at a school can 
        offer information on the student body 
        and focus of the school. Because of this, it can 
        be an important statistic for prospective students, current 
        students, and instituional representatives. So, what department 
        is the most popular department at Davidson College?
    </p>

    <p id="demand">
        This is obviously quite a complex question to answer, so let's 
        break it down. An intuitive place to start is with demand, 
        since demand and popularity should be correlated. 
        The demand for classes within a certain department 
        can be thought of as the total number of times students put a 
        department's course on their webtree. Now if we were to use solely 
        the sum, larger departments would be advantaged. So we can normalize
        by diving the total entries for each course by the maximum enroll size.
        This gives a statistic conveying on average how many students want
        each spot available in a departmental classroom. 
    </p>

    <p id="fullness">
        The top three departments in this statistic are communications, 
        health and human values, and biology. Now just because students 
        are trying to get into these classes does not necessarily mean 
        that they are attending them. Therefore, we can look at a 'fullness'
        statistic, which is the average ratio of students enrolled to the 
        maximum capacity. This will tell us how "full" on average the classes 
        within each department are. 

    </p >

    <p id="priority">
        Looking at our 'fullness' statistic, we see that our previous top three
        are no longer the highest in terms of how full they are. Of the three, 
        biology is the highest being around 95% full. Communications is still 
        quite full with around 90% but HHV is at around 75%. It's interesting
        to note that psychology is over capacity on average and could indicate
        a need for more faculty and classes offered. Now that we have a sense 
        for demand and how full classes are, we can take a look at how much 
        students prioritize getting into a certain department's class. To do
        this, we can sum up the number of students who placed a department's
        class in their highest priority. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In our priority statistic, our clear winners are biology and economics. 
        Suddenly, communications and hhv have dropped to be extremely low compared 
        to other departments meaning that on average students do not feel the need 
        to place a course from one of those two departmens as their highest priority. 
        This can be a signal that it is relatively less competitive to get into a 
        class for communications and hhv whereas it is highly competitive in biology. 
        From personal experience and anecdotes from friends, the economics department 
        has several 'bottleneck' courses that are extremely difficult to get into which 
        can explain the high priority for economics but its relatively low demand. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, there is no clear winner in all three statistics but biology
        ranks highly consistenly in all three measures, and is especially high in both 
        'fullness' and priority. On average, there are more than 6 students competing for each 
        available spot in a biology classroom, biology classrooms are arond 95% full, 
        and almost 500 students (around 28% of student body population) placed a biology 
        class as their highest priority. This makes sense considering the popularity and 
        success of the pre-med track at Davidson in conjunction with how long the biology 
        department has existed, and its amazing facilities in Wall. Therefore, I believe 
        biology is the winner for the most popular department at Davidson.

        I think it would be informative and interesting for future studies to analyze the 
        popularity of departments at Davidson College over time. In this analysis, we are 
        only looking at one year's worth of data so we cannot see trends over time. Understanding
        which departments are growing in popularity could help the College in deciding how to invest
        and allocate its resources with changing interests from the student body. I would suspect that 
        computer science, a very young department at Davidson would be at the forefront in growing 
        popularity.

        The choice of using colored bar charts was intentional for the vizualizations above. 
        A bar chart is a great way to help vizualize the different statistics because it allows
        the audience to easily distinguish the differences between the departments, especially 
        making the extreme values noticeable. 'We know that what makes a feature distinct is that it 
        differs from the surrounding feature in terms of the signal it provides to the low-level
        feature-processing mechanisms in the primary visual cortex' (Ware 30). In the case of the 
        bar chart, the distinctive low-level features are the differences in size for each bar and
        the differences in color of each bar. These are on an intuitive scale where a larger sized 
        bar and a darker color indicate more importance. I personally found that my eye 
        movement with bar charts feels very natural. I typically start in the left and continue to the
        right while moving up and down with the peaks. I find that after my initial scan, I am drawn 
        to the highest values, which are the most important in my vizualization. This is probably because 
        I recognize the highest values to be the 'likely neighborhood of a target' (Ware 38).
